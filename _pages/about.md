Hello! Welcome to the the codeR community. We are mostly based within James Cook University in Townsville, but we welcome any member keen to contribute to our community.

Our main focus is using automation and reproducible code for academic research, but we also mingle with fun coding challenges and other less formal activities.

**We meet every monday at 11am on Zoom.** Please join our [slack](https://coder-tsv.slack.com/) or contact one of the organising committee to get a link. 

You can find us on [github](https://github.com/codertsv/codertsv.github.io) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/CoderTsv)
