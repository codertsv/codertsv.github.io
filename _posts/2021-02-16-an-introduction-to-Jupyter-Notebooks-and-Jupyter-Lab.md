César (@CexyNature) made an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab, and he showed us how we can use R in Jupyter as an alternative development environment. 

César reproduced R code from previous sessions (i.e. Pete's phylogenetic trees and Kevin's shiny app) within Jupyter, and the whole R developing environment can be found in [César's Intro to Jupyter repository](https://github.com/CexyNature/intro_jupyter) and the environment can be launched and used in [My Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CexyNature/intro_jupyter/master).
