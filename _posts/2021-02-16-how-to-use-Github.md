César (@CexyNature) presented a talk on how to use Github. 

Chloë (@BooteCG), as a way to use his instruction tried to make an .md with the notes/instructions in and posted to her github [here](https://github.com/BooteCG/Using-Git-theBasics). 

The [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (free and CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) is a very good source of information.
