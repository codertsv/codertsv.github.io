After the Covid-19 disruption which sent us home, we resumed our weekly meetings using Zoom video conference. In this session, César (@CexyNature) showed us dynamic and interactive plots about Covid-19 exponential growth and transmission. These plots were created using public available data on number of new Covid-19 cases per country, Python, Bokeh and Jupyter Notebooks. The example code can be found in [César's GitHub repository](https://github.com/CexyNature/SARS-CoV-2)
