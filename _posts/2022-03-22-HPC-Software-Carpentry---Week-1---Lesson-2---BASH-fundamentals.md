This is a work in progress. Ready by Monday 28th of March, 2022

## Interacting with the JCU with BASH

BASH is the Bourne Again SHell. A bit about bash and why we need to learn it.

#### Navigating the HPC

- cd
- mkdir
- ..
- .
- pwd
- ls

#### Get files to/from HPC to/from laptop

- FileZilla
- ssh ?

#### Working with files

- nano to create, read
- cat to read non interactively, or to concatenate
- cp to copy, rename
- mv to move files
- rm, with 2000 warnings about rm and asterisks

#### Variables

Should I introduce variables within this lecture?
