Wytamma (@wytamma) presented a talk on using git and Github with RStudio. RStudio has great support for `git` and easily integrated with [Github](https://github.com/). Github is basically a social media platform for CodeRs. Follow your favourite open source projects or programmers. Upload your own code to share and be apart of the community. 

At the end of the session everyone made a pull request (PR) to the website to add themselves [members](/members/) of CodeR-TSV. The members list can be found in the [_data](https://github.com/codertsv/codertsv.github.io/blob/master/_data/members.yml) folder of the website repository.
