# Townsville R coders club

We meet every Monday at 11am for an hour to discuss all things R

### Selection of past presentations

Please find below a selection from our weekly meetings where you can find links to some useful or interesting resources. A complete list of all our meetings can be found at the end of this page.

- 12 October 2020. C√©sar (@CexyNature) did a presentation on Data Management. He described the importance of practicing good data management and he provided advice in what strategies to use to achieve data integration, data interoperability and data intelligibility. C√©sar's used his own data pipelines as an example. The slides of his talk can be found [here](https://cexynature.github.io/data_management/).

- 20 July 2020. C√©sar (@CexyNature) made an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab, and he showed us how we can use R in Jupyter as an alternative development environment. C√©sar reproduced R code from previous sessions (i.e. Pete's phylogenetic trees and Kevin's shiny app) within Jupyter, and the whole R developing environment can be found in [C√©sar's Intro to Jupyter repository](https://github.com/CexyNature/intro_jupyter) and the environment can be launched and used in [My Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CexyNature/intro_jupyter/master).

- 15 June 2020. Ira (@iracooke) took us through some best practices for writing R code and how to use a profiler to optimise code. Ira's notes can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/iracooke/coder-fastr).

- 8 June 2020. Kevin Bairos-Novak (@ecolology) gave an intro to build Shiny apps in R. Kevin's note can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/codertsv/rshiny_covid_app).

- 25 May 2020. Pete (@pete_cowman) gave an intro and demonstrated how to plot phylogenetic trees in R with the package ggtree. After intro he had fun plotting a phylogeny of butterfly fishes. To view Pete's materials on *ggtree* see [his repository here](https://github.com/PeteCowman/ggtree_demo).

- 18 May 2020. Joseph M. introduced the issues around Data storage and reproducibility. Started a conversation on producing guidelines and templates for reproducible research. [Summary notes](/posts/2020-05-18-DataStorage/)

- 11 May 2020. Ira (@iracooke) summarised the key ideas on random vs fixed effects from the previous meeting, and Sonja walked us through her modelling and model selection approach when modelling fetal renal parenchymal thickness during pregnancy. A rough summary of key concepts and ideas can be found [here](/posts/2020-05-11-LMMs-pt2/)

- 27 Apr 2020. Chlo√´ (@CGBoote) lead us through a tutorial on [linear mixed models in R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/mixed-models/). Lorenzo (@ItsFrogday) has summarised the discussion that followed [here](/posts/2020-05-4-LMMs/).

- 20 Apr 2020. Lindsay (@lindsaymarkward) presented a talk via Zoom on clean code best practices with examples in Python. [Link to recording](https://jcu.zoom.us/rec/share/2cl_JqjN3z1JZY3zzHOAYIUGR6riaaa803QWrvcFykkmKbn0t4Tmfb0OHwczcVpu) and password: 4S=k@T$H

- 30 March 2020. After the Covid-19 disruption which sent us home, we resumed our weekly meetings using Zoom video conference. In this session, C√©sar (@CexyNature) showed us dynamic and interactive plots about Covid-19 exponential growth and transmission. These plots were created using public available data on number of new Covid-19 cases per country, Python, Bokeh and Jupyter Notebooks. The example code can be found in [C√©sar's GitHub repository](https://github.com/CexyNature/SARS-CoV-2)

- 24 Feb 2020. Anything goes session on **loops**. #[Link to examples](/posts/2020-02-24-Loops/)

- 16 Dec 2019. Wytamma (@wytamma) presented a talk on Python basics üêç. We used [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) to write and run some Python.

- 2 Dec 2019. Pete (@PeteCowman) presented a talk on using tidyverse to manipulate your data. To view Pete's materials on tidyverse see [here](https://github.com/PeteCowman/tidyverse_demo).

- 25 Nov 2019. C√©sar (@CexyNature) presented a talk on how to use Github. Chlo√´ (@BooteCG), as a way to use his instruction tried to make an .md with the notes/instructions in and posted to her github [here](https://github.com/BooteCG/Using-Git-theBasics). The [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (free and CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) is a very good source of information.

- 18 Nov 2019.  Ira (@iracooke) presented an intro to RMarkdown. The rendered presentation can be viewed on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/iracooke/rmarkdown_intro) and source code is on github at [https://github.com/iracooke/rmarkdown_intro](https://github.com/iracooke/rmarkdown_intro)
