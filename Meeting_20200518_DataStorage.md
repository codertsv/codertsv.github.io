Weekly Meeting - 18th of May 2020

# Data storage and R templates for research analyses

Joseph Moxon presented his take on how to use R for data storage best practices,
and started a conversation on producing R templates for research analyses.

**Ira C.**: data often too large to be stored on the same location as the scripts.

**Cesar H.**: in the process of submitting data. Trying to find good example of metadata
in the Tropical Data Hub, and couldn't find a good example. Looked at papers from his team
and other JCU coworkers, and didn't find complete data, non-available code, mislabelled 
files, etc. 

**Wytamma W.**: Github would be a great place to have private repositories where to share 
code and comment on each others scripts

## Where to from here?

**Ira C.**: It would be good to, as Joseph suggested, subdivide into disciplines and 
produce guidelines. These could include: where to store the data used; things that _have_ to
be included in the script, etc. 

**Joseph M.**: It would be good to **identify key areas** that will likely share similar 
needs and challenges (e.g., Population genomics/Phylogenomics; Medical trials; etc.)

### Expressions of interest

**Peter C**: keen to help produce guidelines for pop gen/genomic data

**Lorenzo B**: keen to help produce guidelines for pop gen/genomic data

## Examples of reproducible data and useful resources

**Legana F.**: Just published a paper, and has script to reproduce everything that was 
done on [github](https://github.com/Legana/AMP_pub) for her [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.5012)

**Cesar H.**: _[Ten simple solutions](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/related?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097) for Digital data storage_ 

**Cesar H.**: Shared his [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.085803v1.full) that will have code available once peer-reviewed 

**Lorenzo B.**: _Good example of pop gen data availability and reproducibility_ [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.5012), see 
supplementary information.

## Coding challenges with **Rosalind**

Ira suggested starting an appended session (15 min on top of the usual 11 am to midday), to
 go over 1-2 rosalind coding problems. Everyone seemed to agree. Peter C. will start a slack 
 channel for it.
