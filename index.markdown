Hello! Welcome to the the codeR community. We are mostly based within James Cook University in Townsville, but we welcome any member keen to contribute to our community.

Our main focus is using automation and reproducible code for academic research, but we also mingle with fun coding challenges and other less formal activities.

You can find us on [github](https://github.com/codertsv/codertsv.github.io) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/CoderTsv)
